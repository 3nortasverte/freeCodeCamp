# Leapwing Audio DynOne v3.0: A Versatile Multiband Compressor Plugin

Compression is one of the most essential and challenging tools in audio production. It can enhance the dynamics, balance, and loudness of your tracks, but it can also introduce unwanted artifacts, pumping, or distortion if used incorrectly.

That’s why you need a compressor plugin that gives you precise and flexible control over your audio signal, without compromising the quality or character of your sound.

One of the best options on the market is **Leapwing Audio DynOne v3.0**, a unique multiband parallel compressor plugin that offers transparent and musical compression for mixing and mastering.

## What is Leapwing Audio DynOne v3.0?

Leapwing Audio DynOne v3.0 is the third major update of its multi-band VST, VST3, AAX plugin that was designed from the ground up using “very soft and great-sounding” linear crossover filters.

Its design allows you to blend compressed filter bands with the original signal, which lets you shape and tone your sound without squashing its dynamics.

DynOne v3.0 has five bands that can be soloed or muted individually, as well as a global section that controls the input, output, mix, and sidechain settings.

You can also adjust the attack and release times, the envelope detection mode, and the channel linking for each band separately or globally.

DynOne v3.0 also has a unique feature called **Center Prominence**, which allows you to control the level of the phantom center in a stereo source without changing the panorama or spectral characteristics.

This can be useful for bringing forward or pushing back vocals, kick drums, basses, or other centered elements in your mix.
